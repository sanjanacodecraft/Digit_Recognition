# Digit_Recognition
# Handwritten Digit Recognition App

A Flutter application that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model. The app allows users to draw a digit on the screen and predicts the digit in real-time using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## 📋 Features
- Interactive Drawing Canvas: Users can draw digits with their fingers.
- Real-time Prediction: Provides immediate feedback on the drawn digit.
- Machine Learning Integration: Uses TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Flutter: For building the user interface.
- TensorFlow Lite: For digit recognition using a pre-trained model.
-  Firebase: App initialization (optional based on Firebase integration).
- Dart: Programming language used in Flutter.

## 🚀 Getting Started
<ins>Prerequisites </ins>
- Flutter SDK installed. Installation Guide
- Dart enabled IDE (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio).
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart.

## 📦 Dependencies
- flutter: SDK for building the app
- tflite_flutter: TensorFlow Lite support
- http: For downloading the model from Google Drive
- path_provider: For accessing the device file system
- image: For image processing
